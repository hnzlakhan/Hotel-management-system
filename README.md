# Hotel-management-system
This project is based on C++ language I use linked list to add room and customer record as it is a linear data structure in which elements in a linked list are linked using pointers so the elements are not bound to be stored at contiguous memory locations. Stack and queue are also implemented .
this project is a full pacakage of hotel management every this that used to be managend in a hotel is included in this project
Firstly you can check-in , for admin they can manage rooms , available rooms are visible.
Customer can be searched by his/her name , check-out and summary.
Then management can add , search and Delete room also they can update existing rooms.
seperate package is created for Type of rooms to select by this it can be easy for management not to type that information again and again for every customer who checked-in.
